# OCCaM Playground
*Authors: Richard Li and Ayush Chakraborty*

A repository containing the work we've done for OCCaM Labs. Current projects include:

1. ARGeoAnchors

This repository contains the documentation + visualizations from our work integrating [ARGeoAnchors](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/arkit/argeoanchor) into the [Clew app](https://github.com/occamLab/Clew/tree/ClewgleMapsARGeoAnchor).

2. Invisible-Map

This repository contains some of our benchmarking work on the [Invisible Map project](https://github.com/occamLab/invisible-map-generation/tree/rawr_work_branch), an attempt to map out a 3-D space and use the POSE of an iPhone to localize a person in their surrounding environment and help them navigate. 

UPDATE: As it turns out, most of the work that we did on this project we ended up doing directly in the repository, as there was a need to keep these benchmarking tools around for future use cases. The link above will take you to the branch on the main repository where most of our work lives
