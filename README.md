This repository contains the documentation + visualizations from our work integrating [ARGeoAnchors](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/arkit/argeoanchor) into the [Clew app](https://github.com/occamLab/Clew/tree/ClewgleMapsARGeoAnchor).

`anchor_data` contains all of the raw json files we downloaded from Firebase

`result_imgs` contains all of the resulting visualizations

`geo_anchor_data_visualizer` contains the python script used to generate these visualizations

`changelog.md` details the changes we made in the main app and how they affected the visualizations

`documentation.md` is a high level overview of our project, why we believe in its relevancy, and how it could affect accessibile navigation going forward.
