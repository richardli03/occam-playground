# OCCaM Playground
*Authors: Richard Li and Ayush Chakraborty*

A repository containing the work we've done for OCCaM Labs. Current projects include:

1. ARGeoAnchors

This repository contains the documentation + visualizations from our work integrating [ARGeoAnchors](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/arkit/argeoanchor) into the [Clew app](https://github.com/occamLab/Clew/tree/ClewgleMapsARGeoAnchor).

2. Invisible-Map

This repository contains our benchmarking work on the Invisible Map project, an attempt to map out a 3-D space and use the POSE of an iPhone to localize a person in their surrounding environment and help them navigate.
