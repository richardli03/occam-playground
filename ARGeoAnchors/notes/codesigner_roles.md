Our project would benefit most from codesigners "playtesting" our current prototype version of the app. We have a pretty good rough baseline for what our app is at least trying to achieve. We'd like to specifically reach out to codesigners in the Boston area for this. 

Screen recordings for people who are not in the area that want to test this

Getting people to videotape the way that they move when they're currently trying to do indoor-to-outdoor navigation + speak up about some of their thoughts. Make sure to judge their comfortability level.

People who are not in the area could be useful in discussions of the UI / how to select a place to travel to. Focus-group esque where we offer different options and they can offer input/other ideas of how this would work.


We can split into focus groups + testing sessions. 


Steps:
1. Reach out to some testers
2. Get a focus group scheduled in
3. Get some tests going on Monday -> Wednesday

TODO:
Reach out to schedule things with Shane so that he can sit in as well.
